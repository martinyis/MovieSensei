        <p className="sm:text-[12px]">
          Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
          mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
          website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
          efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. Cookies set
          by the website owner (in this case, _) are called "first-party
          cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are
          called "third-party cookies." Third- party cookies enable third-party
          features or functionality to be provided on or through the website
          (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties
          that set these third- party cookies can recognize your computer both
          when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain
          other websites.

        <p className="sm:text-[12px]">
          We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some
          cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to
          operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary"
          cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the
          interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online
          Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for
          advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more
          detail below.

          cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide
          you with services. The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the
